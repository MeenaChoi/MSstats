\arguments{
\item{input}{name of MSstats input report from Skyline, which includes feature-level data.}

\item{annotation}{name of 'annotation.txt' data which includes Condition, BioReplicate, Run. If annotation is already complete in Skyline, use annotation=NULL (default). It will use the annotation information from input.}

\item{removeiRT}{TRUE (default) will remove the proteins or peptides which are labeld 'iRT' in 'StandardType' column. FALSE will keep them.}

\item{filter_with_Qvalue}{TRUE(default) will filter out the intensities that have greater than qvalue_cutoff in DetectionQValue column. Those intensities will be replaced with zero and will be considered as censored missing values for imputation purpose.}

\item{qvalue_cutoff}{Cutoff for DetectionQValue. default is 0.01.}

\item{useUniquePeptide}{TRUE (default) removes peptides that are assigned for more than one proteins. 
We assume to use unique peptide for each protein.}

\item{removeFewMeasurements}{TRUE (default) will remove the features that have 1 or 2 measurements across runs.}

\item{removeOxidationMpeptides}{TRUE will remove the peptides including 'oxidation (M)' in modification. FALSE is default.}

\item{removeProtein_with1Feature}{TRUE will remove the proteins which have only 1 feature, which is the combination of peptide, precursor charge, fragment and charge. FALSE is default.}

\item{use_log_file}{logical. If TRUE, information about data processing
will be saved to a file.}

\item{append}{logical. If TRUE, information about data processing will be added
to an existing log file.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If TRUE, information about data processing wil be printed
to the console.}

\item{log_file_path}{character. Path to a file to which information about 
data processing will be saved. 
If not provided, such a file will be created automatically.
If `append = TRUE`, has to be a valid path to a file.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to `data.table::fread`.}
}
\value{
data.frame with the required format of MSstats.
